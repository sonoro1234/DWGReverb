DESCRIPTION::

Generates convolution kernels for early reflections in a mono-to-stereo reverb. Outputs a trigger whenever the buffers change.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: kr

ARGUMENT:: bufL
Left buffer. Both buffers should have the same size, and that size should be a power of 2 for use in link::Classes/PartConvT::.

ARGUMENT:: bufR
Right buffer.

ARGUMENT:: source
The x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the source audio in meters.

ARGUMENT:: receiver
The x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the listener in meters.

ARGUMENT:: roomsize
The width, height, and length of the room in meters.

ARGUMENT:: hw
Ear separation in meters.

ARGUMENT:: b
Reflection coefficient for the room's floor, walls, and ceiling.

ARGUMENT:: n
Controls the number of mirror images to model. n = 0 generates 27 mirror images, and n = 1 to 5 generates 8*(N*2+1)^3 mirror images.

ARGUMENT:: hangle
Head angle in radians. 0 is front, -pi/2 is left, pi/2 is right.

EXAMPLES::
